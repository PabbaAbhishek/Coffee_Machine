# Coffee_Machine
This is a simple software for operating a coffee machine built on python.
As you run the code, it would display a menu of coffee and let you choose your drug.
After checking the resoures available and weather they are enough to produce your coffee, it would proceed and if the resouces shortfall, it would tell the same.
Then you need to insert the money while letting it know what you have inserted (Re.1,Re.2,Re.5,Rs.10,Rs.20).
After verifying the amount you inserted with the cost of the item, it would process the coffee.
After the coffee is done, you get your drug and if excess money was paid, it will give you your change.
## Prerequisites
* Python
#### Note: For real-life situations, I have coded the 'report' keyword, which when given as input, will let you know the resources available in the coffee machine.
#### Also, another keyword 'OFF', to shut down the machine manually.
